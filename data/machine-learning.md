## Machine learning

Machine learning is a field of programming which collects research, implementations, ideas and tools which tasks are to extract knowledge from data and formulate model which later will be used.

### Problem

When we want to use computers to solve our business problems 

### Solution

### ELI5

### Best practices

 * Have part of data moved from training data set. This separate data will be called **test** data and will be used in the end to evaluate quality of model
 * Always spend time to think about evaluation metrics and score. In some contexts, traditionally used metrics like accuracy or mean squared error are not checking if our model is actually solving our problem.
