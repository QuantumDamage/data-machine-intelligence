To start working with data you don't have to know programming. Simplest approach would be to use spreadsheets software (like free [Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)). But if you need to start doing something more complicated you should use Python. Python is general purpose  scripting language and it is released as open source software. It is very popular in scientific projects because of its elasticity.

In year 2008 version 3 of Python was released. Python 3 breaks compatibility with Python 2, so you have to decide which version you will use. Developers of many core Python modules already announced planned end of support for Python 2, so if you don't have to deal with legacy code base you should start with Python 3.

Some operation systems come with Python already included. You can use it out of the box. But even if your system has Python included, you should install special data science tailored Python distribution [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda will ensure that you will always have access to desired Python version and to numerically optimized versions of modules.

Quickest way to start is to download [minimal installer](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) called Miniconda.
