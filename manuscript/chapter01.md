# Algorithms

## Classification

### Naive Bayes

## Regression

### SVM

#### ELI5

In SVM algorithm, the goal is to find thickest "pipe" which will separate classes. In simplest approach pipe will be straight like a line, but we can also look for pipe which will be curvy.

## Universal (classification and regression)

### Trees

### Neighbors

### Linear

## Preprocessing

### Simple algorithms

### Clusters

### Decomposition

### Kernels

## Selectors

### Feature selection

## Neural Networks

### GAN

#### ELI5

Generative adversarial network is pair of neural networks which are connected in such way that one network is trying to generate thing and second network is trying to decide if this generated thing is truly generated or is authentic.
