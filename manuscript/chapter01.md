## Classification

### Naive Bayes

## Regression

### SVM

Support Vector Machine is algorithm used in classification. In simplest example, there are two classes which are mutually exclusive. Every data point is described by n features. We are searching for such n-1 hyperplane, that will divide points according to classes with biggest possible margin. If our n will be 2, so every point will have 2 features, our hyperplane will be 1d - so it will be line. If n will be 3, our hyperplane will be 2d - it will be plane. This is the linear approach.

There is also non-linear approach which allows to construct n-1 dimensional structure which will better fit into classes separation.

#### Implementation



#### ELI5

In SVM algorithm, the goal is to find thickest "pipe" which will separate classes. In simplest approach pipe will be straight like a line, but we can also look for pipe which will be curvy.

## Neural Networks

### GAN

#### ELI5

Generative adversarial network is pair of neural networks which are connected in such way that one network is trying to generate thing and second network is trying to decide if this generated thing is truly generated or is authentic.
